You can call me "Honey" if you want, because I'm the one you want
When anyone called me "Sweetheart"
It was passive-aggressive at the bar
And the bitch was tellin' me to back off
'Cause her man had looked at me wrong
If anyone called me "Honey"
It was standin' in the bathroom, white teeth
They were sayin' that skirt don't fit me
And I cried the whole way home
But you touch my face
Redefine all of those blues
When you say "Honey"
Summertime spritz, pink skies
You can call me "Honey" if you want because I'm the one you want
Wintergreen kiss, all mine
You give it different meaning 'cause you mean it when you talk
Honey, I'm home, we could play house
We can bed down, pick me up
Who's the baddest in the land? What's the plan? (What's the plan?)
You could be my forever night stand
Honey
When anyone called me "Sweetheart"
It was passive-aggressive at the bar
And the bitch was tellin' me to back off
'Cause her man had looked at me wrong
If anyone called me "Honey"
It was standin' in the bathroom, white teeth
They were sayin' that skirt don't fit me
And I cried the whole way home
But you touch my face
Redefine all of those blues
When you say
You can call me "Honey" if you want because I'm the one you want
I'm the one you want
You give it different meaning 'cause you mean it when you talk
Sweetie, it's yours, kicking in doors
Take it to the floor, give me more
Buy the paint in the color of your eyes (of your eyes)
And graffiti my whole damn life
Honey
When anyone called me late night
He was screwin' around with my mind
Askin', "What are you wearin'?"
Too high to remember in the morning
And when anyone called me "Lovely"
They were findin' ways not to praise me
But you say it like you're in awe of me
And you stay until the morning
Honey
When anyone called me "Sweetheart"
It was passive-aggressive at the bar
And the bitch was tellin' me to back off
'Cause her man had looked at me wrong (he looked at me wrong)
If anyone called me "Honey" (ooh)
It was standin' in the bathroom (yeah), white teeth
They were sayin' that skirt don't fit me
And I cried the whole way home (cried the whole way home)
But you can call me "Honey" if you want
