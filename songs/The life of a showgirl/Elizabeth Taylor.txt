Do you think it's forever?
That view of Portofino was on my mind when you called me at the Plaza Athénée
Ooh, oftentimes it doesn't feel so glamorous to be me
All the right guys
Promised they'd stay
Under bright lights
They withered away
But you bloom
Portofino was on my mind and I think you know why
And if your letters ever said, "Goodbye"...
I'd cry my eyes violet
Elizabeth Taylor
Tell me for real
Do you think it's forever?
Been number one but I never had two
And I can't have fun if I can't have...
Be my NY when Hollywood hates me
You're only as hot as your last hit, baby
I been number one but I never had two
And I can't have fun if I can't have... you
Hey, what could you possibly get for the girl who has everything and nothing all at once?
Babe, I would trade the Cartier for someone to trust... just kidding
We hit the best booth at Musso & Frank's
They say I'm bad news, I just say, "Thanks"
And you look at me like you're hypnotized
And I think you know why
And if you ever leave me high and dry
I'd cry my eyes violet
Elizabeth Taylor
Tell me for real
Do you think it's forever?
Been number one but I never had two
And I can't have fun if I can't have...
Be my NY when Hollywood hates me
You're only as hot as your last hit, baby
I been number one but I never had two
And I can't have fun if I can't have... you
Elizabeth Taylor
Do you think it's forever?
If I can't have you
All my white diamonds and lovers are forever
In the papers, on the screen and in their minds
All my white diamonds and lovers are forever
Don't you ever end up anything but mine...
I'd cry my eyes violet
Elizabeth Taylor
Tell me for real
Do you think it's forever?
Been number one but I never had two
And I can't have fun if I can't have...
Be my NY when Hollywood hates me
You're only as hot as your last hit, baby
I been number one but I never had two
And I can't have fun if I can't have... you
All my white diamonds and lovers are forever
In the papers, on the screen and in their minds
All my white diamonds and lovers are forever
Don't you ever end up anything but mine...
