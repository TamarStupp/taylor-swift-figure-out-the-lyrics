You went to a party, I heard from everybody
You part the crowd like the Red Sea, don't even get me started
Did you get anxious though, on the way home?
I guess I'll never, ever know
Now that we don't talk

You grew your hair long, you got new icons
And from the outside, it looks like you're trying lives on
I miss the old ways, you didn't have to change
But I guess I don't have a say
Now that we don't talk

I called my mom, she said that it was for the best
Remind myself the more I gave, you'd want me less
I cannot be your friend, so I pay the price of what I lost
And what it cost
Now that we don't talk

What do you tell your friends we
Shared dinners, long weekends with?
Truth is, I can't pretend it's
Platonic, it's just ended, so

I called my mom, she said to get it off my chest (Off my chest)
Remind myself the way you faded till I left (Till I left)
I cannot be your friend, so I pay the price of what I lost (What I lost)
And what it cost
Now that we don't talk

I don't have to pretend I like acid rock
Or that I'd like to be on a mega-yacht
With important men who think important thoughts
Guess maybe I am better off
Now that we don't talk

And the only way back to my dignity
Was to turn into a shrouded mystery
Just like I had been when you were chasing me
Guess this is how it has to be
Now that we don't talk
