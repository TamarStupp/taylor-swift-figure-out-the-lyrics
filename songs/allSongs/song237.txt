Glistening grass from September rain
Grey overpass full of neon names
You drive
85
Gallatin Road and the lakeside beach
Watching the game from your brother's Jeep
Your smile
Miles wide
And it was not
An invitation
Should've kissed you anyway
Should've kissed you anyway
And it was not
Convenient, no
But your girlfriend was away
Should've kissed you anyway, hey
Shiny wood floors underneath my feet
Disco ball makes everything look cheap
Have fun
It's prom
Wilted corsage dangles from my wrist
Over his shoulder, I catch a glimpse
And see
You lookin' at me
And it was not
An invitation
But as the 50 Cent song played (song played)
Should've kissed you anyway (anyway)
And it was not (and it was not)
Convenient, no (convenient)
Would've been the best mistake
Should've kissed you anyway, hey
Don't make it awkward in second period
Might piss your ex off
Lately, we've been good
Staying friends is safe, doesn't mean you should
Don't make it awkward in second period
Might piss your ex off
Lately, we've been good
Staying friends is safe, doesn't mean you should
When I left school, I lost track of you
Abigail called me with the bad news
Goodbye, and we'll never know why
It was not
An invitation
But I flew home anyway
With so much left to say
It was not
Convenient, no
But I whispered at the grave
Should've kissed you anyway
Ooh, and it was not (it was not)
An invitation (invitation)
Should've kissed you anyway (anyway)
Should've kissed you anyway, anyway (anyway)
And it was not
My advice is always ruin the friendship
Better that than regret it for all time
Should've kissed you anyway
And my advice is always answer the question
Better that than to ask it all your life
Should've kissed you anyway
Should've kissed you anyway
