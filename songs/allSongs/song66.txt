Today was a fairytale, you were the prince
I used to be a damsel in destress
You took me by the hand and you pick me up at six
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale, I wore a dress
You wore a dark gray T-shirt
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale
Time slows down
Whenever you're around
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must've been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must've been the way, today was a fairytale
It must've been the way, today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale, you got a smile, takes me to another planet
Every move you make, everything you said is right
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale, all that I can say, is now it's gettin' so much clearer
Nothing made sense till the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale
Time slows down
Whenever you're around, yeah
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must've been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must've been the way, today was a fairytale
It must've been the way, today was a fairytale
Time slows down, whenever you're around
I can feel my heart, it's beating in my chest
Did you feel it?
I can't put this down
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must've been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must've been the way
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must've been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must've been the way, today was a fairytale
It must've been the way, today was a fairytale
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Yeah, oh
Today was a fairytale
